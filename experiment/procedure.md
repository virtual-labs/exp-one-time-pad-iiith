**STEP 1:** Select a learning scenario from the dropdown menu. Choose from 6 educational scenarios that demonstrate different aspects of cryptographic security and perfect secrecy.

**STEP 2:** Read the scenario description carefully to understand the cryptographic context, including the plaintext, key, and the specific vulnerability or security feature being demonstrated.

**STEP 3:** Use the interactive demo section to experiment with encryption. You can modify the plaintext and key values, then click "üîê Encrypt" to see how the Vernam cipher produces ciphertext through XOR operations.

**STEP 4:** Make your predictions in the "Your Turn" section:

- Predict what the ciphertext will be for the given plaintext and key
- Assess whether you think the encryption scheme is secure or insecure

**STEP 5:** Click "‚úÖ Check My Answer" to receive immediate feedback. The system will:

- Verify your ciphertext prediction against the correct XOR result
- Evaluate your security assessment based on cryptographic principles
- Provide detailed explanations about why the scheme is secure or vulnerable

**STEP 6:** Study the learning feedback to understand:

- The mathematical principles behind perfect secrecy
- Common vulnerabilities like key reuse, pattern predictability, and short key expansion
- Real-world implications of these security concepts

**STEP 7:** Progress through all scenarios to build comprehensive understanding of:

- When Vernam cipher achieves perfect secrecy (proper key length, randomness, single use)
- What makes encryption schemes vulnerable (key reuse, patterns, information leakage)
- How to identify and analyze cryptographic weaknesses
