## Objective

- To understand the concept of **perfect secrecy** and its mathematical definition according to Shannon's theorem
- To demonstrate that the **Vernam cipher (One-Time Pad)** achieves perfect secrecy when implemented correctly
- To explore why **improper key usage** (short keys, key reuse) breaks perfect secrecy
- To analyze encryption schemes and determine their security by finding plaintext collisions
- To experience the practical challenges of implementing perfectly secure encryption systems
